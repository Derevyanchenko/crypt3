								<b>
									(NAME SURNAME)
								</b>
								<p>
									<i>
										Now at home, with a smile on my face I remember my last summer, when I woke up early in the morning, went to work in the office and drank a cup of my favorite cappuccino on the way.

									</i>
								</p>
								<p>
									I lived in a small town and my family could not allow me to use modern things and travel. My dream from the childhood was travelling, which I was captivated reading books of Jules Verne, Daniel Defoe and other authors.
								</p>
								<p>
									As I dreamed about traveling, after school I enrolled to college at the “Tourism” faculty. Since childhood, my parents instilled in me that thanks to good studies, I could achieve great heights. I studied hard at college, participated actively in college and believed that it would help me in the future.
								</p>

								<p>
									During the last courses, we had a job fair at which I sent (gave?) my CV to many. I was overly happy, when one of the travel companies after reviewing my resume made me a job offer. 
								</p>

										MY WORKING SPACE

									</p>
								</div>
								<p>
									I went to work with a big pleasure and tried to understand all aspects of the tourism business. My position was an associate specialist and it was impossible to dream about huge salary then.   I worked hard and dreamed that in the near future my career would begin to grow and the salary would increase accordingly. But I was young, I wanted to fulfill my dreams and travel. With each salary, I tried to save a small amount of money, which would not harm my existence, and in a year I would be able to collect a significant amount to go on my first trip.

								</p>
								<p>
									I met a guy from a nearby office and he had a similar dream. We began to develop relations with him. We loved to meet with him after work and discuss the future directions of our trip. He liked the countries of Asia, I liked the western world more. He and I planned to go to China for a few days in the winter and see the Ice City, the most important winter attraction. But then media reports began that some new virus had appeared and was spreading very much. This scared us very much, we postponed our trip to a later date and did not attach much attention to this news. 


								</p>
								<p>
									But our plans had to be destroyed. Everything began to develop incredibly fast. I began to notice a gloomy mood among the management, constant stressful situations, daily screams began in the office and everything looked very gloomy. I began to ask my colleagues about the reasons for this mood and the news shocked me. Many tourist destinations began to close, airlines stopped flying along the routes, people began to refuse trips en masse and return their tickets. The management of the company was blacker than the autumn cloud.
								</p>
								<p>
									Furthermore, that day has come. I came to work, I was called to the personnel department and there they informed me that due to the situation on the tourism market and in the world in general, they had to optimize the staff and, as I was new, I was asked to write a letter of resignation. The HR manager assured me that this is a temporary solution and as soon as the situation improves, I will be called back
								</p>
								<p>
									At first, I believed that the situation would improve soon and they would call me back to the office. Everything turned out to be much worse. Almost the entire office was fired and sent home. I could not believe that all my plans were crumbling due to some kind of virus. It was a real stress for me. Since childhood, I dreamed of traveling, studied at "Tourism", worked in a travel company. It seemed to me that now I received a reward for my efforts and everything turned out completely wrong.

										EMPTY OFFICE
									</p>
								</div>
								<p>
									I thought that the company would give me some kind of payment, but the financial situation of the company was terrible. The company incurred huge debts could not pay off the team. However, it is very good that I had some savings that I put aside on my summer trip. I watched the news and began to realize that the situation was dragging on and it was very unlikely that everything would end in a couple of weeks.

										ALL MY SAVINGS
									</p>
								</div>
								<p>
									I calculated how much money I have and how it should be disposed of correctly in order to last as long as possible. According to my calculations, with my expenses, the accumulation is enough for 3 months. Nevertheless, this did not please me, if I spend all the money on food, then I will not be able to go on a summer trip.

								</p>
								<p>
									My savings amounted to about EUR 3,000. I got a lot of free time that I spent on social networks (Facebook, Instagram) and accidentally got to the site <a href="http://coronabillionaire.com/" target="_blank">(SITE NAME)</a>. The site was very informative and it contained detailed instructions on how passively you can make money on the Internet. I was very interested in the scheme described there, it was very simple even for me, although I do not like mathematics from school and everything else related to economics
I had a huge interest in this topic and I began to look for various additional information. I found many interesting groups on social networks in which people shared their experiences and earning schemes, published strategies. From all the information I collected, I realized that trading crypto on the site <a href="http://coronabillionaire.com/" target="_blank">(SITE NAME)</a> is one of the easiest and cheapest methods available to me, and it is also a very good platform for novice traders, which I consider myself to be.

									<p class="bold">
										ALWAYS BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND YOUR OPPORTUNITIES
									</p>
								</div>
								<p>
									From the very beginning, I chose a strategy for myself and began to stick to it. My plan had positive results from the very beginning and I was overly glad about it. I started to take simple steps and earned my first passive money – EUR 100 during the day. At first, I was afraid that it could be a pyramid and I would lose my money, but I tried to withdraw it and everything worked out for me - but the first money from the Internet came to my card. I was over the moon!

								<h2>
									What did we learn from her experience?

								</h2>
								<p>
									(NAME) was able to easily earn her first money on the Internet during the epidemic and continue to save on her childhood dreams - travel and discover the world. All this became possible for her thanks to <a href="http://coronabillionaire.com/" target="_blank">(SITE NAME)</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									Financiers from New York: “Thanks to this opportunity, hundreds and thousands of people can earn during the crisis, and here the opportunity to make money is much higher than playing the lottery. Clients began to apply us much more for advice, because they are rapidly getting rich and want to increase their fortune. A rather interesting fact is that many new clients before that worked in simple positions, similar to: office plankton, manager and waiter. Now, many people have begun to earn much more than the CEOs of large companies in London or Berlin. ” 

								</p>
								<p>
									This is a very fast car for making money. I am sure that very soon you will hear about it on all the central channels and in the entire world media.

								</p>
								<p>
									This type of earnings began to develop in the 2000s and since then financiers, analysts, investors and other financial professionals have been able to earn thousands of dollars from nowhere. This area is much more effective than opening your own business. You do not have the hassle of renting an office or sales.

								</p>
								<p>
									I learned that trading on <a href="http://coronabillionaire.com/" target="blank">(SITE NAME)</a> works by buying when prices rise and selling when prices fall. This is called a “quick sale” when you just opened a position and the profit comes into your own hands.

								</p>
								<p>
									The amazing fact is that 9 out of 10 Europeans have not even heard of such a site and method. There is no need for special knowledge, you can use the site even if you do not know anything about trading and have never invested your money anywhere:
								</p>
				
								<ul style="list-style-type:square">
									<li>
										You don’t need to know anything about trading (The less you know, the better for you, because there will be no fear); 
									</li>
									<li>
										You don’t need special knowledges about investments;

									</li>
									<li>
										You don’t need a huge sum to start;

									</li>
									<li>
										You don’t need a lot of free time, a maximum of an hour per week.

									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									All you need to do is just to make a deposit (AMOUNT OF DEPOSIT) to open your safe account and to start earning money.
								</p>
								<p>
									You are in no way limited in finances. You can deposit, for example, 1 thousand and 3 thousand and 5 thousand euros at a time without any problems. Your amount will begin to increase in a few hours and you can withdraw interest for your purposes.
								</p>
								<p>
									Every European can learn this in a very short time. You do not need experience in a bank, consulting, investment or audit. You do not even need a higher financial education. If you did not like math at school, this is not a problem either. There are no subordinates and leaders as you work for yourself. There is no guessing of further forecasts of growth or fall. As soon as you make your first deposit to the site, further control will take you no more than a few hours a week. You can safely watch how money grows while sitting in a restaurant or while relaxing in warm countries.
								</p>
								<p>
									This is a truly revolutionary site, citizens usually expect a profit of no more than 10% and only on this site you can return your money 10, 50 and 100 times more! It is awesome!
								</p>

								<div class="results">
									<a href="http://coronabillionaire.com/" target="_blank">
										<img src="img/gains.png" style="border: 1px dotted #00B1DD" width="600">
									</a>
									
								</div>
							
								<p>
									Does all this sound very tempting and good to sound true? Most Europeans thought so from the very start of the epidemic: 
								</p>
								<ul style="list-style-type:square">
									<li>
										(NAME), was able to earn more than 10 thousand euros after he was quit; 
									</li>
									<li>
										(NAME) at the age of 25 he received a birthday present from her father for a gift of EUR 300, which she invested and now at home receives %;

									</li>
									<li>
										A charitable foundation (TITLE) invests and for the interest received helps hospitals treat the injured.
									</li>
						
								</ul>
								<div class="results">
									<a href="http://coronabillionaire.com/" target="_blank">
										<img src="img/checks.gif" width="600"></a>
									
								</div>
								<p>
									We want to warn you to hurry. The financial elite of the world is very afraid that many Europeans will now start remotely making money. Many banks no longer want to conduct transactions to replenish the deposit and then replenish their account with thousands of euros. Investment companies are on the brink of survival, as they lose millions of dollars every day and try their best to regulate European access to the site so that ordinary citizens do not become rich in one week.
								</p>
								<h2>
									SUMMARY
								</h2>
								<p>
									As a user, you may begin to doubt efficiency a bit <a href="http://coronabillionaire.com/" target="blank">(WEB SITE NAME)</a>, but you should give yourself a chance to try and then verify the reality of the results. The stories of people are real and speak for themselves. You should not even be afraid to lose your money, because the site provides an opportunity to return fully your initial deposit.
								</p>
								<p>
									The media will not report about this site and method now, because this is one of the secrets of Wall Street. World financial leaders do not want ordinary citizens to have the opportunity to get rich so quickly, because wealth is power and freedom. This is something that world leaders do not want to share with others.
								</p>
								<p>
									In such difficult times as now, every citizen deserves the opportunity to earn passively his fortune.
